# Challenge2-VisionDrive

1. PC Vision Drive Code - VisionDriveMultiLines.py (runs on drivestation/simulator machine)
2. Pi Vision Drive Code - VisionDriveMultiLines_Pi.py (runs on Raspberry-Pi).

Next Improvement - investigate remove using contours (since we really ain't using it for shape detection per say).  Just use the resulting HSV rectangle and use its total area, this will make things less sensitive and drive a lot better and less jerky.
